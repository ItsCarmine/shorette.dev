Currently studying Applied Math and CS at [UW–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).

This summer, I'm working as a Middleware Development Intern at the [Department of Employee Trust Funds](https://etf.wi.gov/).

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with Linux systems (I use Arch BTW) and playing chess.

Lately, I've been obsessed with building option pricing models. Twitter DMs always open!

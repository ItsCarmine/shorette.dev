I'm not really qualified to give advice, but through many books I have been told life advice from people much wiser than me. I thought this would be an area to take what I agree with from the people I think are much more intelligent than me.

You must accept that you would be much happier if you accepted and admitted to yourself that the reason you don't have what you want is simply because you do not want it badly enough.

> **Central Question:** Do you want to be happy or do you want to achieve what you want?
> 
> *You should always be asking yourself this.*

Write more! It clarifies your thoughts and stops from asking yourself the same question repeatedly.

Whenever possible in your life, get rid of complexity. This is one of the core tenants of my life. I try to live like a minimalist, both *(especially!)* digitally and in the physical world.

I really feel like I treat myself like shit sometimes. If I asked "What would I do if I really hated myself?":
- Stay home all day.
- If my friends don't ask to hang out, don't reach out to them out of fear of rejection.
- Don't ask the girl out.
- Never learn to talk to strangers.
- Work hard and make tons of money but die an unhappy old man with regrets.
- Neglect my health and my body.
- Never be grateful and only focus on what I have yet to achieve.

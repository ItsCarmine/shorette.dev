A collated list of my personal productivity tips. While these strategies have been effective for me, productivity is highly personal. Consider these tips as potential starting points for strategies you can explore.  
  
Why focus on productivity? If you are able to achieve a small productivity gain, the compounded difference is massive in the long term. Avoid falling into the trap of toxic hustle culture. The goal is sustainable improvement, not burnout. It must be treated like a long-term investment strategy: consistent, measured efforts yield the best results over time.  
  
Many people have posts about productivity on their page. My favorites are Sam Altman's [Productivity](<https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity>) and Near's [Productivity Tips](<https://near.blog/productivity-tips/> "Productivity Tips"), where most of this work is derived.

## Schedule intelligently

All time is not equal. Recognize your personal energy patterns and schedule your tasks accordingly. For many, including myself, mornings are peak productivity hours while evenings bring lower energy. Take time to analyze your own rhythms and structure your day to capitalize on your most productive periods.

Equally important is scheduling time to do nothing. This isn't wasted time – it's invaluable. These pockets of unstructured time allow your mind to wander, giving you space to think about what to work on next. After all, it doesn't matter how fast you move if it's in a worthless direction. These moments also open doors for encounters with ideas, media, or conversations that can spark innovation.

## Use a to-do list

The humble to-do list seems to remain an underutilized tool. Make lists for what you want to accomplish this year, each month, and each day. Many people may prefer paper, but I have tried a myriad of digital to-do list apps like [Todoist](www.todoist.com) and [TickTick](www.ticktick.com), although I currently favor [Amazing Marvin](www.amazingmarvin.com). However, the specific tool matters less than making the creation of lists a daily habit.

When populating your list, prioritize tasks in a way that builds momentum for the day.

## Don't work against diminishing returns

Most activities feature diminishing returns correlated to the amount of times you check them. Checking X or Hacker News might provide value the first time, but repeatedly in the same day, and the value decreases until it is negative. Analyze when you are stuck in a loop of refreshing your feed.  
  
In this same vain, limit checking the news to once a day, but preferably, try to go a week if possible. Especially politics. Almost none of it is important. If it truly is important, it is almost guaranteed you'll hear about it from someone else.  
  
Usually, we check these apps because we have time throughout the day where we have small arbitrary amounts of time and we must fill the gaps (i.e. waiting for a lecture to start). Social media and instant messengers are commonly used during these times, but find fresh, more productive activities, like reviewing cards in an Anki deck or re-reading a book on your phone.

## Optimize your sleep

This is the most experimental section I will write about since I really haven't figured it out myself. I have found that prioritizing sleep over extra-work is much more beneficial in the long-term. Wake up at the same time everyday.

If you use technology before bed, use features like Eye comfort shield on Android or Night Shift on iOS. Also software like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) or [redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift) on the desktop are valuable. In general, decrease your brightness whenever you can. I've also used blue light blocking glasses with success.

Besides blue light usage, consider ear plugs, a sleeping mask, mats that can decrease temp while you sleep (like the [Chili Pad](<https://sleep.me/> "Chili Pad")). Black out your bedroom as best as possible and avoid eating shortly before bed.

## Other physical factors

Always be conscious of and proactive about your hydration. It's not just about drinking water, though – be mindful of electrolytes too. Proper electrolyte balance allows your body to absorb and utilize water effectively. In particular, I've found that magnesium can work wonders if you often feel sleepy. Many people are unaware that magnesium deficiency is a leading cause of fatigue.

When it comes to nutrition, I've discovered that I perform at my best when I avoid sugars (including simple carbohydrates) early in the morning. Instead, I emphasize protein, fruits, and vegetables to start my day.

It's well-known that regular exercise improves memory, thinking skills, and concentration. While I don't currently have a consistent gym routine, I'm experimenting with incorporating more physical activity into my daily life.

Remember, these physical factors – hydration, nutrition, and exercise – form the foundation of your body's ability to function optimally. By paying attention to these basics, you're setting yourself up for improved productivity in all areas of life.
